# Hi there, I'm Pranjal! 👋

*Turning caffeine into code and data into decisions since forever.* ☕️

As a **Co-Founder**, **VP of Engineering**, and **Data Scientist**, I blend technology, data, and business strategy like the perfect cup of coffee.

- **Leader by Day, Data Whisperer by Night**: I lead awesome teams to build complex systems and make data-driven decisions (occasionally using Jedi mind tricks).

- **LLMs, ViT, and Vision Wizardry**: Currently diving deep into **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Vision Transformers (ViT)**, and **ViLT**, working on cutting-edge vision use cases at my company.

- **Startup Captain**: Steering my startup, [Neophyte](https://neophyte.ai/), to bring our innovative products—**Sentinel**, **Disha**, and **Neometry**—into the spotlight.

- **Math Enthusiast**: With a foundation in mathematics, I tackle **Deep Learning** and **Computer Vision** challenges—because who doesn't love a good algorithm before breakfast?

- **Innovation Junkie**: Thriving at the intersection of tech and business, always pushing boundaries and looking for the next big thing (hoverboards, anyone?).

**Let's team up and turn some wild ideas into reality!**
